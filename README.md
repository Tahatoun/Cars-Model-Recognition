# Cars-Model-Recognition
a system to classify and recognise cars models using deep learning and computer vision


### Prerequisites

pyhton - 
OpenCv - 
keras 

### Step 1 : Data collectionning and cleansing

all data we used is in here


### Step 2 : Logo recognition using SIFT algorithm 

```
# predefined SIFT function in OpenCV library 
sift = cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT_create()

```




### Step 3 : image recognition using deep learning and computer vision
we used convolutionnal neural networks to make the classifiers , as deep neural networks are actually very popular and aknowledged to be performant in classification tasks .

As the tendacy goes for making layers deeper and deeper , we used  **ResNet50** initialy with empt weights and trained it on the data we gathered 

#### Why ResNet50
